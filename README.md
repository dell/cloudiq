# CloudIQ

CloudIQ is the AIOps application that provides proactive health monitoring, recommendations, and predictive analytics for Dell infrastructure systems.

This repository contains a set of artifacts (scripts, code samples, configuration files, etc.) that are related to Dell CloudIQ, and, more specifically, to CloudIQ integration (REST API and Webhook). The content of this repository is targeted to DevOps and SRE teams.

CloudIQ integration allows customers to interface CloudIQ with other tools in their ecosystem, from collaboration (ex: Slack, Teams) to ITSM (ex: ServiceNow), in order to automate flows and reduce toil.
